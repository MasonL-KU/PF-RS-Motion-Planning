This folder contains several animated results from the simulator in .gif format.

The filenames begin with the particle count for that simulation. N500 indicates a 500 particle simulation.

The plot type is indicated as "BirdsEyePlot", "ChasePlot" or "ScenarioPlot"

BirdsEyePlot is a top-down view that follows the ego vehicle path and tracks its orientation.

ChasePlot is a chaseplot of the ego vehicle. Pretty self-explanatory.

ScenarioPlot is another top-down view, but is zoomed out to show the global scenario from a static position.
